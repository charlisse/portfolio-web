        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> 
        Hi! I'm Charlisse Newcombe, an aspiring web developer based on the beautiful Gold Coast, Australia.  
        I began my journey into web development after graduating high school class of 2024, driven by a long-standing interest in coding and technology. 
        What started as curiosity quickly grew into a passion for creating clean, functional and engaging digital experiences.
        Whether I'm building a responsive website or experimenting with new frameworks, I enjoy turning ideas into interactive solutions that are both user-friendly and visually appealing.
        Outside of coding, you'll often find me trail running as it's my favourite way to reconnect with nature and clear my mind after a day spent online. 
        I'm always eager to take on new projects, collaborate with others, and continue growing in this ever-evolving field. 
        </p>
