        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> 
        Hi! I'm Charlisse Newcombe, an aspiring web developer based on the beautiful Gold Coast, Australia.  
        I began my journey into web development after graduating high school class of 2024, driven by a long-standing interest in coding and technology.   
        </p>

        <p>
        Outside of computers, you'll often find me running along the coastline or through the bush as it's my favourite way to reconnect with nature and clear my mind after a day spent online. 
        I love the outdoors and keep myself busy by having many active hobbies such as soccer, tennis and triathlons. 
         </p>

         <p>
        I'm always eager to take on new projects, collaborate with others, and continue to grow to be the best version of myself. 
        </p>
